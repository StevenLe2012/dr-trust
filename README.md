Obviously, this is not what your README should say on-submission. Change it. Yes, the whole thing.

This is where a description of your project will go. README.md files support [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Setup

**Oh yeah, by the way, don't forget to set up `git lfs` on your machine.**



### Hardware Required

- Meta Quest 3

### Software Dependencies
DO WE NEED?
- Division Game Engine version `2024.1.26`
- Michaelsoft Binbows `XD`

## Run

### APK Method
1. Sideload this [APK](https://www.google.com/) onto your Quest. Many ways to do so:
    1. [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/)
    2. [Meta Quest Developor Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/meta-quest-developer-hub/)
2. 



### GitHub Method
```shell
# install the sotware
sudo apt install -y cmatrix
# run the trap
cmatrix
```

3. After the process completes and you don't even see the code, anymore, you are ready. Here is what it looks like:

```js
"b" + "a" + +"a" + "a"; // 'baNaNa'
```

## Shout-Outs

BEZZIIIIIII WE LOVE YOUUUUU <3 Bezi made our lives so much easier with such an intuitive way of desigining our work.

Sebastian Yang, thank you so much for your amazing dedication to our cause. How we started off with disecting bodies on a beach, to now increasing trust and transparency with surgery.

Steve Lukas, you're the one that lights the path for the younger generation. We love your humor, humbleness, and motivation to seamlessly integrate XR into a specific purpose of life.


Best regards,
